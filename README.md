# Code Clock Web

Authors:
- Leonardo Ferrisi, University of Utah

## Description
Code Clock Web is a web-application based implementation of the Code Clock cardiac arrest coordination device.

## TODO
Eventually, utilize Capacitor.js to compile this into cross platform applications

# Notes

No this is not the ideal implementation of the react-variant.
For proof-of-concept button labels are hard-coded (gross)

I pray for forgiveness from Linus Torvalds, Bjarne Stroustrup, Dennis Ritchie, Guido van Rossum, and Ryan Dahl.
